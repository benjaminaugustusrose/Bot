# Roadmap: Swing Trading Bot for Analysis

This roadmap outlines the key phases, milestones, and tasks required to build and release a trading bot focused on swing trading analysis.

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Requirements

- **Define Objectives**
  - What markets/instruments will the bot support? (stocks, crypto, forex)
  - What platforms will it connect to? (e.g., Binance, Alpaca, Interactive Brokers)
  - Is it for analysis only or will it eventually execute trades?
- **Research Regulations**
  - Understand compliance requirements for your jurisdiction(s).
- **Feature List**
  - Signal generation (entry/exit points, alerts)
  - Backtesting engine
  - Performance metrics tracking
  - Risk management tools
  - Extensible for new strategies
- **Technology Stack Decisions**
  - Programming language (Python, Node.js, etc.)
  - Libraries for data (Pandas, TA-Lib, ccxt, etc.)
  - Hosting/environment (local, cloud, Docker)
- **Timeline & Resourcing**
  - Estimate time for each phase
  - Identify team members or collaborators

---

## Phase 2: Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

- **Select and Integrate Data Sources**
  - Historical price data
  - Real-time market data APIs
- **Data Storage**
  - Choose database/storage format (CSV, SQLite, Postgres, etc.)
- **Data Cleaning & Normalization**
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and data quality checks

---

## Phase 3: Core Bot Development

- **Strategy Implementation**
  - Build modular architecture for strategies (moving averages, RSI, MACD, etc.)
  - Implement swing trading logic (trend detection, volatility filters)
- **Backtesting Engine**
  - Simulate strategy performance on historical data
  - Performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, win rate, etc.)
- **Signal Generation & Alerts**
  - Notification system (email, Telegram, Slack, etc.)

---

## Phase 4: Risk Management & Optimization

- **Position Sizing Algorithms**
  - Fixed, percent risk, Kelly criterion, etc.
- **Stop Loss/Take Profit Logic**
- **Parameter Optimization**
  - Grid search, walk-forward optimization

---

## Phase 5: User Interface & Reporting

- **Dashboard**
  - Web or CLI dashboard for monitoring and control
- **Reporting**
  - Trade logs, performance summaries, charts

---

## Phase 6: Testing & QA

- **Unit & Integration Tests**
- **Paper Trading Mode**
  - Simulate live trading without risking capital
- **Bug Fixes & Refinement**

---

## Phase 7: Deployment & Release

- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, etc.)
- **Documentation**
  - Setup guides, usage instructions, API docs
- **Beta Release**
  - Invite alpha/beta users for feedback
- **Production Release**
  - Public launch and marketing

---

## Phase 8: Post-Release & Maintenance

- **Monitor Performance**
- **Handle User Feedback**
- **Iterate and Add Features**
  - Support new strategies, exchanges, or reporting features

## Example Timeline (3-6 months)

| Month    | Milestone                      |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1        | Requirements, data integration |
| 2        | Core bot & backtesting         |
| 3        | Risk mgmt, UI, paper trading   |
| 4        | Testing, docs, beta release    |
| 5-6      | Public launch, maintenance     |

---

**Tip:** Start with analysis-only, then add live trading later for safer incremental development.
